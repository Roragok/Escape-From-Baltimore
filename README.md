Navigate around the station and tracks to arrive at the Eutaw Stree Ticketing Office to Camden Yards

## Eutaw Street
Head through the main gates on Eutaw street from the south side.  Head up Eutaw street.
Head through some stadium to  come out by Pickles.  Pickles Safe Room

## Pickles

Navigate through Pickles -> Bullpen -> Sliders.  Down Camden Street to Convention Center

## Convention Center

Navigate through the main entrance of the convention center.  Possible try to theme zombies like Otakon? lol
End up in a business outside or possibly a room in the connecting Hyatt Hotel.
## The National Aquarium
Navigate from safe room exact sport TBD. Head to the National Aquarium.

Some type of Holdout inside the Aquarium for finally to boat/sub in harbor.
